This image shows the hardware with a green "altitude" LED and an unlit, red "collision" LED.

During a collision with the ground, the green LED is dimmmer (lower altitude) and the RED lights up briefly.  It's a bit difficult to see the nuance of the LED intensity here.  Maybe in lower lighting better live images could be obtained.
